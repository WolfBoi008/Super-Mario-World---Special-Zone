# Super Mario World - Special Zone Goal
An Archipelago Manual for Super Mario World, with reaching the end of Special Zone being the Goal. Originally submitted for the #RemixItUp Async.

## **Notes**
- Start on a fresh save file.
- Start at Yoshi’s Island.
- For the time being, Switch Palaces are plando'd to be on their matching levels because they're not something you can undo in the base game. Once you activate them, they're activated for good.
- For now, any levels past Donut Plains don’t count, but **at some point in the future, this will likely be changed so all levels are added**.

## **Goal**
- Beat the final level of Special Zone.

## **Items**
- Progressive Powerup (Mushroom, Flower, Feather)

- Super Star

## **Checks**
